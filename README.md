# cloudinit-tests

Collect samples in `cloud-init` testing. These tests are used in virtual machines. The virutal machine provider is `virtualbox` and managed by `vagrant`.

The tests are primarily done in `centos`. Some `ubuntu` tests will be added later. They are separated in to their own folders.
